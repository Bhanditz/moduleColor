{Expression data in a multi-set format (see \code{\link{checkSets}}). A vector of lists, 
with each list corresponding to one microarray dataset and expression data in the component \code{data},  
that is \code{expr[[set]]$data[sample, probe]} is the expression of probe \code{probe} in sample 
\code{sample} in dataset \code{set}. The number of samples can be different between the sets, but the 
probes must be the same. }
